🗓️ Devlog – April 12, 2025
🛠 Refined project structure for MatchaBook and modularized code

 Refactored the Reddit scraper code into smaller modules:

reddit_client for Reddit API setup

fetch_posts for fetching posts and comments

db_handler for database interactions

 Structured the project to enhance maintainability and scalability

 Tested that the refactored code runs successfully and modularly

 Updated .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., .env, matchabook.db)

 Updated requirements.txt to reflect new dependencies

 Successfully committed changes and pushed to GitHub
